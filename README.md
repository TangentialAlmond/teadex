# TeaDex
The TeaDex is a "Pokedex" for tea that aims to catalog information on tea through community contributions of photos and their knowledge on the cultivation and processing workflow. Currently, version 0.1 of the public-client (view only) is deployed at https://teadex.onrender.com/. As the deployment is on the free-tier of Render, the TeaDex website may take a few minutes to load initially.

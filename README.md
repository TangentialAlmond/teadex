The TeaDex is a "Pokedex" for tea that aims to catalog information on tea through community contributions of photos and their knowledge on the cultivation and processing workflow. Currently, version 0.1 of the public-client (read-only) is deployed at https://teadex.onrender.com/. As the deployment is on the free-tier of Render, the TeaDex website may take a few minutes to load initially.

Tea session count: 14 🍵

## 🌟 Project Overview
TeaDex is a visual database designed for tea enthusiasts and researchers. It focuses on the aesthetic and technical details of dry tea leaves.

The project features a split-client architecture:
* **Admin Client:** A CRUD application for managing, suggesting, and editing tea entries.
* **Public Client:** A read-only gallery for users.
* **Shared:** A core directory for components and logic used by both clients to maintain DRY principles.

## 🔮 Preview
Currently, only the public-client is live at https://teadex.onrender.com/. Here's a sneak peek of the early version of the admin-client with the minimum CRUD application features.

## 📜 Coding style
To ensure maintainability, this project follows a style guide:
- **Indentation:**
  - JSX/Components: 2 tabs
  - JS/Logic: 4 tabs
- **Formatting:**
  - No semicolons at line endings.
  - Max line length of 80 characters.
- **Practices:**
  - Use functional components and custom hooks.
  - State must be sanitized via `loadEntryData` to handle database `null` values.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
**Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB (Local or Atlas)
- AWS S3 bucket

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TangentialAlmond/teadex
    cd teadex
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend && npm install

   # Install admin-client dependencies
   cd ../client/admin-client && npm install

   # Install public-client dependencies
   cd ../public-client && npm install 
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file under the `/backend`:
   ```text
   NODE_ENV=development

   MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_uri>
   PORT=<your_port>

   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=<your_resid_rest_url>
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=<your_redis_rest_token>

   AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<your_aws_bucket_name>
   AWS_REGION=<your_region>
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key>
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_access_key>
   ```
4. Run the backend server (from `/backend`):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Run the admin- or public- client server (from `/client/admin-client` or `/client/public-client`):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
6. View the locally-hosted severs in your browser via `localhost:YOUR-PORT` (replace `YOUR-PORT` with the port you've set e.g. `5001`).
